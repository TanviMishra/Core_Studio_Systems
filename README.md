**Prompt: Create a website that is a proverb** <br/>

**Project:** <br/>
**"A rolling stone gathers no moss"** <br/>
The website is the rolling stone within this metaphor, when you stop rolling, aka scrolling, some moss appears on the screen and the content fades away. <br/>
Scrolling the website reverts it back to the original state. <br/>
The website content chronicles the usage of the proverb in rock music. <br/>
Extra Feature: click the record to play music and watch it spin as you scroll through the page. <br/>

# Futures Research <br/>
**Prompt: Considering a potential future that results from the impact of a current social phenomena, create an object or design that might exist in that future which involves some type of interface. ** <br/>

**Project:** <br/>
**"Carbon Accounting"** <br/>
Most of us know that climate change is our reality, weâ€™re aware that things are getting worse and a collective reckoning is required to counter the drastic changes to our environment. But, we can loose sight of that in our day-to day. My end-goal is to provide a visceral, jolting  effect on the viewer and to further cement the realities of climate change in their minds. </br>
the two problems I am speculating on are a. changing our monetary relation to tackling the climate crisis and b. accounting for historical debts by weighted work to form more equitable social structures. I have created a prototype of my simulation to present some of this research and additional information on the simulation / game can be found below.
