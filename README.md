Prompt: Create a website that is a proverb
Project: "A rolling stone gathers no moss"
          The website is the rolling stone within this metaphor, when you stop rolling, aka scrolling, some moss appears on the screen and the content fades away.
          Scrolling the website reverts it back to the original state.
          The website content chronicles the usage of the proverb in rock music.
          Extra Feature: click the record to play music and watch it spin as you scroll through the page.
