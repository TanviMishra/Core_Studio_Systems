Prompt: Create a website that is a proverb <br/>
Project: "A rolling stone gathers no moss" <br/>
          The website is the rolling stone within this metaphor, when you stop rolling, aka scrolling, some moss appears on the screen and the content fades away. <br/>
          Scrolling the website reverts it back to the original state. <br/>
          The website content chronicles the usage of the proverb in rock music. <br/>
          Extra Feature: click the record to play music and watch it spin as you scroll through the page. <br/>
