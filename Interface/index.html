            <h2>A Bit of Backstory</h2> 
            <p>Initially there was earth, now there are only <span class="underline">remains</span>. We knew that we had to change something... we knew, but did nothing.</p>
            <p>The <span class="underline">ice caps</span> were melting, <span class="underline">temperatures</span> were rising and <span class="underline">resources</span> were vanishing; but we were busy yelling at others online. We had created a hell for ourselves and like the alleged frog, we were barely beginning to realise it. As protests increased, as more summits were held, as president jumped back and forth, a creeping sensation of doom pricked at our conscience.</p>
            <p>We began to consume less meat, we shifted to clean energy, and we tried to buy fewer artefacts. We continued on with our lives, feeling lighter. Until one day when we realised that the ice caps were still melting, temperature was still rising and resources were nowhere to be found. Now, <span class="underline">we rioted, we demanded change,</span> our lives necessitated rigidity.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">AlCorps</span> heard us. They invented the <span class="underline">carbon calculator</span>–an app that would calculate your exact carbon footprint with each decision you made. It is hilarious to look at the primitive app they launched–filled with bugs and incomplete datasets. With time, companies slowly came onboard, they started releasing more information and the app had an increasing number of downloads.</p>
            <p>It hit record high levels when Sri Amaravathi–clean influencer and idol– downloaded and praised the app. The site crashed within the next 20 minutes as everyone scurried behind their pied piper. AllCorp points became social currency: <span class="underline">a sign of culture, conscientiousness and empathy</span>. We would reject booty calls on tinder because of lower carbon scores and proudly display our score on resumes. </p>
            <p>Eventually Silicon Valley realised we could be incentivised to work better by promising social score promotions. We started to trade in our score for paid leave and exchange it for work place benefits. We barely realised it happen, but slowly our scores dictated most of our lives. We ditched our fat student loans for alternative career parts, <span class="underline">choosing to acquire and exchange credit points</span> with others.</p>
            <p>Then the <span class="highlight">Wave</span> came. It <span class="underline">engulfed 187</span> countries and nearly 60% of world population. Some of us claim that the signs were always there, others call it divine intervention. Regardless of what happened, we had to move on. All our energy, all our choices are now directed to <span class="underline">curbing the wave</span>. We need to keep a check on our AllCorps score. We work to salvage what's left of our resources. We try to stay afloat.</p>
            <p>Everything has changed, but all our problems still <span class="underline">remain.</span></p>

            <p>This was a project designed for core studio systems @ parsons school of design. This is an imagining of a speculative future where
            our lives are dictated by our personal, historic and predicted CO2 emissions. We trade in 'Carbs' to buy artefacts and get better jobs. 
            All our actions directly influence both our 'carb-count' and the sea levels that are rising at alarming rates. This is a future in which
            being mindful of the environment is baked into our everyday actions, social status and profficiency.</p>
